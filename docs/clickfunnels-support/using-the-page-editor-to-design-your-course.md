The Page Editor is essential for creating an effective online course. By learning to use it, you can structure your content logically, add engaging elements, and ensure your course is easy to navigate. This helps students find and absorb information more easily, leading to better learning outcomes. This article explores the key steps of using the Page Editor to design a well-organized course that enhances the learning experience for your members.

Enabling Advanced Customization for Course Pages

To customize your course home and module pages, you need to turn on the Advanced Customization feature.

Navigate to the Courses app from the left-side menu.

Select the course from which you want to customize.

Click on the Customize tab on the course overview page.

Locate the Advanced Customization toggle switch.

Click the toggle to turn it on. The switch will turn blue when active.

You can now select a custom theme using the Change theme option.

IMPORTANT

The theme you select for your course may already include some essential elements. These pre-configured elements provide a starting point for your course design. You can:

Reposition existing elements to suit your preferred layout.

Edit the settings of these elements to match your course style.

Add new elements to further customize your course pages.

As you follow the customization steps in this article, keep in mind that you may not need to add every element from scratch. Instead, you might be adapting or enhancing the existing theme structure.

Click Save to apply your changes.

Customizing the Course Sidebar

The course sidebar helps students navigate through your course content. It displays the course structure, including modules and lessons, allowing for easy movement between different sections. You can customize various aspects of the sidebar to match your course design and improve the learning experience for your students.

In the page editor, locate or add the Sidebar element.

Click on the Settings ⚙ icon to display its settings.


Adjust the following settings as needed:

Top Margin: Use the slider to set the space above the sidebar.

Render Mode: Choose between “classic” or “ascension” styles in the dropdown menu.

Show drip modules: Toggle between “Yes” to display all modules or “No” to hide inaccessible dripped modules in the course sidebar.

Width: Adjust the sidebar width using the slider.

Padding Top and Padding Bottom: Fine-tune the internal spacing.

Vertical Spacing: Control the gap between sidebar items.

Background Color: Select a color that complements your course design.

Mobile Hamburger Color: Choose a color for the mobile menu icon.

Gap Between Modules: (Only available in classic render mode) Adjust the spacing between module sections in the sidebar.

Completed Checkmark Color: Select a color for the progress tracking checkmarks. This feature displays small checkmark icons next to completed lessons in the sidebar, helping students visualize their course progress at a glance.


Left Indentation Spacing: Set the indent level for sub-items.

Disable Left Icons: Toggle to show or hide icons next to items.

Disable Checkmark Icon: Toggle to turn off the completion checkmark icons if desired.

Content Depth Truncation: Control how many levels of content are visible.

Customize Sidebar Modules settings to adjust the appearance of module sections within the sidebar.

Configure Course Depth settings:   Course Depth refers to the different levels of content hierarchy in your sidebar. For example:

Depth 1 might be main modules

Depth 2 could be sections within modules

Depth 3 might represent individual lessons

Each depth level can have its own styling, allowing you to visually distinguish between different levels of your course structure. To customize:

Scroll down to “Course Depth 1”, “Course Depth 2”, etc., in the settings menu.


For each course depth, you can adjust typography, colors, and other visual elements to create a clear hierarchy in your sidebar navigation.

Enable Border to add an outline to the sidebar.

Toggle the Shadow setting to add a shadow effect for visual depth.

After adjusting the settings, click Save on the top right to apply your changes.

Saving and Previewing Your Course Pages
Saving Your Work

In the Page Editor, locate the Save button in the top-right corner.

Click Save after making changes to your course page.


Wait for the save confirmation to ensure your updates are stored.

Previewing Your Course Page

In the Page Editor, click the Preview icon next to the Save button.


A new tab will open, displaying a live preview of your course page.

Check for any formatting issues, broken links, or design inconsistencies.

Close the preview tab when you're ready to continue editing.

Important

To see dynamic content like modules and lessons in the preview, you must first publish the course. If the course is still in draft mode, these elements will not appear. Additionally, if a dynamic section has no content attached, it will remain hidden even after publishing. For detailed instructions, refer to the Getting Started with Courses article.

Important

Some course pages use dynamic content such as modules, lessons, or elements that are automatically pulled into the page:

If your course page includes dynamic content but nothing has been added yet (such as a module without any lessons), the section will not appear in the preview.

This is expected behavior since dynamic elements only display when content is attached.

To see how dynamic content looks, ensure you’ve added at least one module, lesson, or item before previewing.
