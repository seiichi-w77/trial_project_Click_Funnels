Funnel tags are labels you can attach to your funnels to keep everything organized and easy to find. Think of them as folders or categories that help you group related funnels together. For example, you can tag funnels based on their purpose, such as “Lead Generation” or “Product Launch,” making it simple to locate and manage them later. In this article, we’ll show you how to add and manage funnel tags so you can keep your funnels organized and save time when working on your marketing campaigns.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

An existing funnel

Adding a New Funnel Tag

Navigate to Workspace Settings in the sidebar menu, click Tags, and select Funnels.

Click Add Funnel Tag in the upper-right corner of the Funnel Tags page.

Enter a unique name for the tag in the Name field (e.g., "Webinar" or "Imported").


Select a color to visually distinguish the tag by clicking one of the available color options.

Click Create Tag to save the new tag.

IMPORTANT

Tag names must be unique. Tag names are case-insensitive, so “Funnel Tag” and “funnel tag” are treated as the same. If you create a tag that already exists, the system will still create the tag but automatically add a suffix to make it unique.

Example: Creating a tag called “BlackFridayPromo” when one already exists will create “BlackFridayPromo (Duplicate)”.

Additional duplicates will be numbered: “BlackFridayPromo (Duplicate 2)”, “BlackFridayPromo (Duplicate 3)”, etc.
