The Cart Icon element in ClickFunnels is a standalone feature that allows customers to track and access their shopping cart on any Store, Site, or Landing page. It displays the current cart state and allows customers to open and view their shopping cart by clicking the icon. In this article, you will learn how the Cart Icon works, its functionality, and how to set it up.


Requirements 

An active ClickFunnels account

Any store, site, or landing page

Where to Use the Cart Icon

The Cart Icon element can be used on Store pages (e.g., Product, Storefront, Collection, and Checkout pages). In addition, it also works on Site pages and Landing pages when the Add to Cart element is added within the Products Collection element.

It provides a consistent and user-friendly way for customers to view their cart status and access their shopping cart as they shop. Whether they add items to the cart, return to browse more products, or complete their order, the Cart Icon dynamically updates to reflect the current cart state and allows customers to open the cart for further action.

Adding a Cart Icon Element in the Page Editor

Inside the page editor, add a Section where you want to place the element.

Add a Row within that section.

Click the orange + Plus or Add New Element button inside the row to insert a new element.

From the Checkout category, select the Cart Icon element.


Note:

In the Storefront and Product page, the Cart Icon element needs to be added from the Commonly Used category.

Once the Cart Icon element is added, you can customize its appearance to fit your page design.

How the Cart Icon Works

The Cart Icon ensures a smooth and intuitive shopping experience for your customers by keeping track of their cart status in real time and allowing easy access to the cart.


Cart Updates Across Store Pages:

When a customer adds a product to the cart using the Add To Cart button, the Cart Icon immediately updates to display the total number of items in the cart.

This update is persistent across all Store pages. For example, if a customer adds an item to the cart on a Product page and then returns to the Store Front, the Cart Icon will display the updated item count.

Access the Shopping Cart:

By clicking the Cart Icon, customers can open the shopping cart panel from the right side of the page. This panel shows all items added to the cart, their quantities, and the total cost.

Shopping Continuity:

Customers can add products to their cart and continue browsing without losing their cart state. The Cart Icon remains visible and accessible across all Store pages, showing the number of items in the cart and providing access to the cart.

Empty Cart State:

When the cart is empty (e.g., after completing an order or removing all items), the Cart Icon updates to reflect this state. For instance, if a customer lands on the Order Confirmation page after completing a purchase, the Cart Icon will display an empty cart.
