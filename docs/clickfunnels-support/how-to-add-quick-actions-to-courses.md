Course quick actions allow you to set up automated workflows triggered by specific events in your courses. This feature helps streamline course management and enhance student engagement.

You can add quick actions at three levels:

Course level

Module level

Lesson level

Once you set up a quick action, it will automatically run when the specified trigger event occurs. This allows you to automate tasks like sending congratulatory emails or unlocking bonus content. In this article, you’ll learn how to set up, manage, and effectively use Course Quick Actions to optimize your course management and student engagement.
