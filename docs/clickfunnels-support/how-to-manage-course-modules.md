Adding a Drip Delay to a Module

Drip modules allow you to control when specific course content becomes available to your students. This feature is useful for pacing your course, preventing overwhelm, and keeping students engaged over time. Here’s how to set up drip modules in your ClickFunnels course:

On the Course page, Find the module you want to drip.

Select Drip from the dropdown menu.


In the Edit publishing window, enter the number of days to wait before the module is available.

Click Update module to save.

Hiding Dripped Modules

ClickFunnels offers settings to hide dripped modules in different parts of your course interface. This feature creates a cleaner, more focused learning environment by only showing content that’s currently accessible to students. Here’s how to manage these settings:

Hiding Dripped Modules on the Course Page

In the course editor, locate the Course Modules element.

Click on the Settings ⚙ icon to display its settings.


In the Settings sidebar, find the Filters area.

Locate the Filter by drip access dropdown.

Select Hide Drip Course Modules to hide inaccessible modules  on the main course page.


Hiding Dripped Modules in the Course Sidebar

In the course editor, locate or add the Sidebar element.

Click on the Settings ⚙ icon to display its settings.

In the right Settings sidebar, locate the Show drip modules toggle.

Switch it to No to hide dripped modules in the course sidebar.


Locking a course Module

Lock modules allow you to control access to course content based on the completion of other lessons. Here’s how to set it up:

On the Course page, Find the module you want to lock.

Select Lock from the dropdown menu.

In the Edit publishing window, choose a “Blocker lesson” from the dropdown menu. This is the lesson that must be completed 1. before the locked module becomes available.

Click Update module to save.

Duplicating a Module

Click the three-dot button to the right of the module status, then select Duplicate Module from the drop-down menu.


Click the Proceed button on the pop-up to duplicate the selected module.

The page will display a banner at the upper-right of the page explaining that the module is being duplicated. The site will also display the duplicated module under the original module in Draft status.

NOTE

The site duplicates the module and lesson content (e.g., Title, Description, Media, and Content).

Adding an Upgrade Offer

The Upgrade Offer setting allows you to sell access to specific modules. Enter the URL of your payment or checkout page. When a user views the course outline and doesn’t have access to a module, the module title will appear as a clickable link if an Upgrade URL has been set. Clicking this link opens the checkout or order page in a new tab, allowing users to purchase access directly. This feature helps you monetize individual sections of your course or offer tiered pricing options for your content.


Click the three-dot icon on the right side of each module, then select Edit Module from the drop-down menu.

In the Upgrade URL field, enter the full URL of your checkout (order form) page.

Click Update module to save your changes.


Click Update module to save.

Drip-delayed modules are hidden unless the user is enrolled and the delay has passed.
