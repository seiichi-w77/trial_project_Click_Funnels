Using NMI with ClickFunnels requires integration through Payments AI. In this article, we’ll explain how to connect NMI with ClickFunnels, how Payments AI enables payment routing, and how you can use multiple payment gateways effectively.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

The Payments AI app added to your workspace

A verified NMI account linked to Payments AI

Connecting NMI to Payments AI

ClickFunnels does not directly connect to NMI; instead, it integrates with NMI via Payments AI. To use NMI in your ClickFunnels workspace, you must first link your NMI account within Payments AI.

To learn how to connect NMI to Payments AI, please refer to this Payments AI guide: Getting Started - Connecting NMI.

Once NMI is connected and the status shows CONNECTED in Payments AI, ClickFunnels can begin processing payments using NMI for all your funnels and store products.

Using Payment Gateway Routing Rules in Payments AI

Payments AI provides a feature called Gateway Automation Rules, allowing you to route transactions through different payment gateways based on customized conditions. If you have multiple payment gateways connected, such as Payments AI and Stripe, you can set specific rules to determine which gateway should process each payment.

For example, you could route some transactions through Payments AI while directing others to Stripe. Suppose you want to split the load evenly—50% of all transactions could be routed through Payments AI, while the remaining 50% are handled by Stripe. Alternatively, you might prefer that payments from certain geographic locations are processed exclusively by Stripe while others are handled by Payments AI.

For a detailed guide on setting up these rules, please refer to the Payments AI documentation: Setting Up Payment Gateway Routing Rules.
