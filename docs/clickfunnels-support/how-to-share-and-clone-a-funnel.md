Sharing and cloning funnels in ClickFunnels is a valuable feature that allows you to generate a unique share link. This link can be shared with customers or your audience, enabling them to make a copy of the funnel in their own ClickFunnels account. This feature is incredibly useful for distributing successful funnel templates. By easily sharing funnels, you can save time and ensure your audience has access to effective tools for their campaigns.

IMPORTANT

Due to different setups in each workspace, some actions in the funnel might be lost during sharing. Please ask the person you shared with to review the funnel and manually fix any missing actions or steps to ensure everything works correctly.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

A funnel created in your workspace

How to Generate a Share Link

You can generate a share link for your funnel template in two simple ways, which we will explain below:

(Option 1) Generate a Share Link from the Funnel Builder Settings

Navigate to Funnels from the left-side menu.

Click on the funnel you wish to share to open the Funnel Workflow Editor.

Click the Settings button at the top-right corner of the funnel workflow page.


In the pop-up, click the Generate a Funnel Share Link button.


(Options 2) Generate a Share Link from the Funnel Settings

In the Funnels dashboard, click on the gear icon of your funnel to access the Settings.

NOTE

You may need to scroll horizontally to the right to see the icon, especially if your screen is smaller or has limited display space.

In the Settings page, scroll down and Click on the Generate a Funnel Share Link button.

Next Steps

A new window will appear where you can add more details for your link:

Public Funnel Name: Enter a name for the funnel that others will see.

Affiliate Code: Add your affiliate code if applicable.

Public Affiliate Name: Enter your public affiliate name.

Reshare: Choose whether others can reshare your funnel link by selecting Yes or No.

Category: Choose between “Generate Leads” or “Sell Products”.

Once all fields are completed, click the Generate a Funnel share link button at the bottom of the window.

The Share Funnel Link will be generated automatically.

Click the Copy button to copy the link to your clipboard.


You can now share the link with your audience. They will be able to import the funnel into their own ClickFunnels account easily.

The sharing status will appear as Active by default, with a Change button next to it. To manage the setting, click Change. This opens a pop-up where you can turn the Active toggle off and click Save Changes. When sharing is inactive, anyone who tries to open the link will see a message that the funnel could not be found.


IMPORTANT

If you make changes to your funnel after generating the share link, those changes will not be reflected in the version already shared. To share the latest version, open the Share settings and click Republish Funnel.

Funnels from ClickFunnels Classic cannot be shared into ClickFunnels (formerly ClickFunnels 2.0) accounts. However, you can migrate your funnel pages using BarnumPT.

For step-by-step instructions, see the article: Migrating Funnel Pages from ClickFunnels Classic Using BarnumPT.

You can share the funnel in another workspace by pasting the link in your browser. A new page will appear asking, “Where would you like us to install your new funnel?” Select the desired workspace to complete the process.

Understanding the Difference Between Frameworks and A Funnel Share

ClickFunnels allows you to share resources in two different ways: Frameworks and Funnel Share. Both options enable you to distribute assets with other users, but they differ in what gets shared, how it is structured, and how the recipient interacts with the shared content.

Frameworks

A Framework is a structured collection of resources that can be used to share funnels while including additional supporting assets. It acts as a comprehensive package that allows users to access and customize various components before building their own funnels.

When sharing a framework, you can include:

Funnel templates

Themes for design consistency

Courses for education or training

Automated workflows to streamline processes

Pre-built landing pages

Stores with associated products

Email templates for marketing campaigns

Opportunity pipelines for sales processes

Frameworks are ideal when you need to provide a complete, structured package that allows users to create and customize their own funnels with supporting elements. They are especially useful for agencies, educators, and businesses that distribute standardized resources.

Once a framework is shared, recipients can modify its components as they build their own assets, but any updates made to the original framework do not affect existing user implementations.

to learn more about creating and managing frameworks in ClickFunnels, refer to the How to Create and Manage Frameworks in ClickFunnels article.

Funnel Share

A Funnel Share, on the other hand, is a way to duplicate and transfer a specific funnel as a complete, ready-to-use setup. It provides an exact copy of the funnel, including its pages, automation workflows, settings, and (if applicable) product configurations.

When sharing a Share Funnel, the recipient receives:

All funnel pages and layouts

Funnel settings and products, if applicable

Share Funnels are designed for quick and easy funnel duplication, making them ideal for sending a fully functional funnel to a client, team member, or another ClickFunnels user. Unlike frameworks, Share Funnels do not include additional resources like courses, themes, or email templates.

Once imported, the shared funnel becomes independent of the original, meaning any changes made to the original funnel will not sync with the shared version.
