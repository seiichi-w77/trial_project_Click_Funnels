Overview of the Appointments App

The ClickFunnels Appointments is a powerful app that allows you to easily manage and schedule various types of events, such as meetings, consultations, or training sessions. This feature ensures that your invitees can book time with you without the hassle of back-and-forth communication. By integrating your calendar, setting up event types, and adding conferencing connections, ClickFunnels Appointments makes scheduling straightforward and efficient.

Example:

Imagine you are a fitness coach offering one-on-one training sessions. With the ClickFunnels Appointments app, you can create an event type called “Personal Training Session,” set the duration to 60 minutes, and link it to your Google Calendar. Your clients can then see your available time slots and book a session that fits their schedule. Additionally, you can add a Zoom conferencing connection so clients can join the training session virtually, directly from the calendar invite they receive after booking.

This streamlined process not only saves time but also ensures that all your appointments are organized and easily accessible in one place.

The feature lets you communicate these changes directly to your client through automated emails, keeping them informed and ensuring a smooth experience.

You can easily view, reschedule, cancel, and edit your scheduled events from the Scheduled Events menu in the Appointments app. To manage your scheduled events, follow these steps:
