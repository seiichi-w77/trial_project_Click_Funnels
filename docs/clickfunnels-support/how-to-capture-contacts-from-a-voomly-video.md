Voomly is a powerful video platform that makes engaging with your audience easy and fun. In this article, you’ll learn how to capture leads using Voomly’s Turnstile feature in ClickFunnels. The Turnstile feature from Voomly prompts viewers to enter their information to continue watching the video, and you can place this prompt anywhere in the video you like. By integrating these interactive videos into your page, you can create a dynamic way to connect with your audience and boost your lead generation. Let’s get started!
