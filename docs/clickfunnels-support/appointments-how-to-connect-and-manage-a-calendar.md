Editing Appointment Calendar Settings

Editing your appointment calendar settings in ClickFunnels ensures your scheduling preferences are accurately configured. Follow these steps to update your calendar settings:

Navigate to the Appointments app.

Select Calendar Connections.

Locate the calendar you wish to edit.

Click the Gear ⚙️ icon on the right side of your calendar to open the settings.

Edit Calendar Settings:

Name: Modify the name of the calendar to make it easily identifiable.

Default Calendar: Unless specified otherwise, the default calendar serves as the primary destination for scheduling and organizing events. Toggle this setting to enable or disable the default status.

Note:

Only one calendar can be set as the Default (Bookable Calendar).

Check For Conflicts: This setting ensures the calendar system checks for any scheduling conflicts before confirming a new appointment. When enabled, the system will scan existing events on the connected calendars to identify overlapping times. If a conflict is detected, it will prevent double bookings by notifying you of the issue or automatically blocking the conflicting time slot. Toggle this setting to enable or disable conflict checking.

After making the desired changes, click the Update Calendar button to save your settings.

Deleting a Calendar Connection

To delete a calendar connection in ClickFunnels, follow these steps:

Locate the calendar you wish to delete.

Click the Trashcan 🗑️ icon next to your Calendar connection.

Click the Proceed button to confirm the deletion.

Warning:

Deleting a calendar connection does not automatically cancel or remove scheduled events from your calendar. The scheduled events will remain active in your external calendar.

All the upcoming events in the Scheduled Events menu, will be marked as inactive. You will no longer be able to edit, cancel, or reschedule these events within the Appointments app.

Your customers will not be able to book new appointments for the event.
