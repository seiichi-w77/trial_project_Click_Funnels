Understanding Course Themes

Course themes control the overall design and layout of your course pages. They determine how content is presented, how students navigate through lessons, and how branding elements like colors and typography appear.

Using the right theme helps create a learning experience that feels structured and engaging. Themes can be customized to match your brand, improve readability, and adjust key design elements for better accessibility.

Each course consists of different page types, including:

Course Home: The main dashboard where students access modules and lessons. A theme can change its layout, banners, and color scheme.

Module Lessons: Organizes lessons within modules. Customizing a theme can refine the way modules are displayed and structured.

Lesson Page: Where the actual content is delivered. Themes affect how videos, text, and interactive elements appear.

To learn more about creating and managing themes in ClickFunnels, refer to the Creating and Managing a Theme in ClickFunnels article.

Customizing the Course Theme

Course themes give your online course its unique look, affecting how lessons, modules, and navigation appear. A well-structured theme makes it easier for students to stay focused and move through the content without distractions. Some themes keep things simple, while others offer more design elements to match different teaching styles. Picking the right one helps create an experience that feels polished and engaging from start to finish.

There are two ways to set up your course theme in ClickFunnels:

LearningHub View (Default): Every course starts with this built-in, minimalistic layout designed for a clean and structured learning experience. It keeps the focus on content and ensures a consistent look across courses.

Advanced Customization: If you want more control over your course’s appearance, you can switch to an advanced theme. The course theme can also be set up in the Course Settings under the Theme section. Please visit our article Course Settings for more information about the course settings.

Important

The course URL dynamically updates when the course’s theme is changed. Make sure to check and use the new link after switching themes.

Only the Site domain can be used for courses. While you can connect multiple domains to your ClickFunnels account, courses are restricted to the site domain. For more information, check the How to Connect a Domain to Your Site and Funnel article.
