To analyze data, you first need to access a specific report from the Reporting page. Once inside a report, you can adjust filters, select date ranges, and compare data to gain deeper insights into your funnel performance.

Selecting a Date Range

Each report allows you to choose a specific time frame to analyze performance over different periods.

Comparing Data

Some reports offer a comparison feature to analyze current performance against a previous period.

Click the "vs" dropdown next to the date selector.


Select the previous time frame you want to compare.

The report updates to show percentage increases or decreases alongside the current data.

💡 This helps spot trends, seasonal changes, or the impact of recent optimizations.

Applying Filters

Filters help narrow results based on specific criteria, such as funnels, products, or landing pages. You can select up to 5 items at a time, depending on what the filter dropdown allows in that report.

Click the filter dropdown (if available) in the report.
