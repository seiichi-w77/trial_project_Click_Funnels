What is the Discounts feature in ClickFunnels?

Discounts in ClickFunnels are special codes that you can create to offer customers reductions on their purchases in the store and funnels. These can be percentage-based discounts and fixed-amount discounts applied to specific products or collections.

For example, if you run an online fitness store, you can create a discount code “SUMMER20” that offers 20% off during the summer season. When customers enter this code at checkout, they will receive a 20% discount on their purchase, encouraging them to buy more and boosting your sales.
