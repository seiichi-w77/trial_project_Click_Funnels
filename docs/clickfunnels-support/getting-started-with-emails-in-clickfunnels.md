Why Email Marketing Matters for Your Business

Email remains one of the most powerful tools for customer engagement and sales. Unlike social media, where algorithms control visibility, email allows you to communicate directly with your audience. Whether you’re nurturing leads, onboarding new customers, promoting special offers, or automating follow-ups, email provides a cost-effective way to build strong relationships and drive revenue.

ClickFunnels' email tools enable businesses to:

Stay Connected with Your Audience
People don’t always buy the first time they see an offer. Emails let you check in, provide value, and remind them why they were interested in the first place. A well-timed message can turn a maybe into a yes.

Automate Your Follow-Ups
Sending emails manually takes time. Automation helps you send the right message at the right time. Welcome emails, special offers, and abandoned cart reminders can all run in the background while you focus on other parts of your business.

Keep Your Business in Front of Customers
Even if someone doesn’t buy today, regular emails keep your brand fresh in their mind. When they’re ready, you’ll be the first business they think of.

Real-World Examples

An online store sends a discount code to customers who added items to their cart but didn’t check out.

A course creator welcomes new students with an email series that introduces them to the content.

A local business updates customers about special events and exclusive deals.

A coach or consultant shares helpful tips before inviting leads to book a call.

Adding Marketing Contact Address

Your Marketing Contact Address appears at the bottom of your emails and is required by international spam laws, including the CAN-SPAM Act. This helps ensure transparency and allows recipients to contact your business if needed.

From the ClickFunnels dashboard, select Workspace Settings and then Email Settings.

In the General Settings tab, enter your business information:

Name/Company: Add your company or brand name.

Address 1 & 2: Enter your business address.

Country, City, State, and Postal Code: Provide the complete location details.


Scroll down and Save your changes.

Adding a Custom Email Address

A custom email address is an email that uses your own domain instead of a generic provider (e.g., yourname@yourdomain.com instead of Outlook or Yahoo). Using a custom email makes your messages look more professional and improves email deliverability.

ClickFunnels provides temporary email addresses using the @clickfunnelsmail.com shared domain. However, this address is only for testing purposes and is not suitable for marketing. You can send a maximum of 100 emails using this temporary email before needing a custom domain.

Before adding a custom email address, you need to have your domain set up in ClickFunnels. If you haven’t set up your domain yet, follow the steps in this article: Domains - How to Connect an Existing Domain (Automated Setup).

Once your domain is set up, you can add a custom email address.

How to Add a Custom Email Address

Go to Workspace Settings and select Email Settings.

Click on the Email Addresses tab.

Click Add Email Address.


Fill out the required details:

Name: This will appear as the sender name in emails.

Nickname: A reference name for internal organization.

Username: The part before @ in your email (e.g., "info" in info@yourdomain.com).

Domain: Select the domain linked to this email address.

Click Add Email Address to save.

Once added, your custom email can be used for sending broadcasts and workflows. If you need to update or archive an email address, you can do so from the same Email Settings page. For detailed steps, check out this article: How to Add a Custom Email Address in ClickFunnels.

Triggering Email Workflows from a Funnel

You can trigger a workflow with an email step when someone takes action in a funnel, such as opting in or completing a purchase. This ensures emails are sent automatically based on user behavior.

Choose the funnel step (e.g., an opt-in page) where the workflow should activate.

Click the Lightning Bolt icon next to the funnel step.

Once attached, the workflow will run automatically, sending emails when users complete the selected funnel step.

Affiliates: Emails sent to affiliates for approvals, commissions, and account creation.

Courses: Notifications for course enrollments, module access, and removals.

Orders: Emails related to invoices, order status, fulfillment, cancellations, and digital asset access.

Appointments: Alerts for scheduled, rescheduled, and canceled appointments for hosts and invitees.
