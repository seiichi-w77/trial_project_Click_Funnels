Imagine you’re a fitness coach with various online funnels for your business: a webinar funnel for weekly fitness webinars, a sales funnel for your fitness merchandise, a course funnel for your online fitness programs, and an opt-in funnel for gathering leads through free workout guides. Each funnel is designed to attract and engage potential clients in different ways. In ClickFunnels, you can connect your domain to multiple funnels, so you don’t have to get new domains for each one. You can effectively manage your marketing efforts by strategically assigning paths for each funnel. This article will guide you through the process of using a single domain for multiple funnels.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

At least two funnels created in the workspace

A domain verified in the workspace

How to Connect a Domain to Multiple Funnels

Click on the Funnels menu from the navigation on the left side.

Identify a funnel you wish to associate with your domain and click the Gear ⚙️ icon to access the funnel’s settings.

In the Domain field, select the desired domain from the dropdown menu.

Enter the desired path in the Funnel Path URL field, such as /webinar, /blog, or /about.

Alternatively, you can access these settings directly within your funnel. Open the funnel, click the Settings button in the top-right corner, and then follow steps 3 and 4.

Click Update Funnel to save changes.

Repeat these steps for each additional funnel you wish to connect to the same domain.

Important:

A path that is already in use cannot be assigned to another funnel or page. For instance, if /webinar is already assigned to a funnel or landing page, it cannot be reused for a different page to prevent conflicts. When you enter the path name, ClickFunnels will indicate whether the URL is available or already in use.

Congratulations! You now know how to utilize a single domain for multiple funnels.
