Creating Custom Paths with Splits

Splits allow you to create custom paths through your survey based on respondents’ answers or scores, leading to more relevant data collection and improved user engagement. By using splits, you can tailor the survey experience to each respondent, asking only the most relevant questions based on their previous answers. Here’s how to use Splits in your survey workflow:

Click the + sign and select Add Split from the options.

Click the yellow ⚠ icon to access split options:
    

Add Question: Add a new question to the split branch.

Edit Rules: Set conditions for when this split should occur.

Change Target: Specify where to direct respondents (e.g., to different questions or to end the survey).

Delete Split: Remove the split if needed.

To set up split logic, click Edit Rules.

Choose to create rules based on specific answers, cumulative scores, or contact attributes.

Set your conditions and save the rule.

Adding Actions to Survey Workflows

Survey Workflows also allow you to automate tasks based on the responses. You can add actions to apply tags, send emails, trigger workflows, and more when a respondent answers a question in a certain way.

After adding a question, click the + icon next to it.

Select Add Action from the dropdown menu.

Choose an action, such as applying a tag, sending an email, or triggering another workflow.


Configure the action details, then click Create action.

Set the rules for when the action should be triggered by clicking the branch icon and specifying the conditions (based on specific answers or scores).

NOTE

If you want an action to apply to all survey respondents, you don't need to set a rule.

Save the action.

These options allow you to create sophisticated survey flows that adapt to each respondent’s answers. For more detailed instructions on creating and managing Survey Workflows, please refer to the How to Create and Manage Survey Workflows article.

Analyzing Survey Results

Regular analysis of these results will help you make data-driven decisions for your business based on audience insights. Here’s how to access and interpret the data collected:

In the Survey Workflows app, find your survey in the list.

You have two options to view submissions:    

Click on the number in the Submissions (started/completed) column.

Click on the graph icon to the right of the survey name.


On the submissions page, review respondents’ answers, scores, and survey completion details.

Click on a specific contact submission to see detailed responses for each question.

Look for patterns in responses to identify audience trends and preferences.

Compare the Started and Completed times to assess how long respondents spend on your survey.

Best Practices for Creating Effective Survey Workflows

Aim for surveys that take 5 minutes or less to complete. Shorter surveys typically have higher completion rates.

Begin with simple, engaging questions to encourage participants to continue.

Use clear, specific language. Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms that might confuse respondents.

Ask one thing at a time. Each question should focus on a single idea to avoid confusion and ensure accurate responses.

For Choice and Image Choice questions, offer a range of options that cover all possible responses.

Group related questions together and follow a natural progression from general to specific topics.

For multiple-choice questions, consider adding an “Other” field to capture unexpected responses.

Use splits strategically to create personalized survey experiences, showing respondents only the most relevant questions based on their previous answers.

Always test your survey before publishing to catch any errors or unclear questions.

Respect privacy by only asking for personal information that’s necessary for your survey’s goals.
