The Cart Component in ClickFunnels is a built-in feature that displays the shopping cart when customers click the Cart Icon on any Store page. It works like a popup, sliding in from the right side to show cart contents, allow quantity adjustments, and provide a direct path to checkout. In this article, you will learn how the Cart Component functions and interacts with the Cart Icon element.

How the Cart Component Works

The Cart component is an integrated feature of the ClickFunnels Store, not a standalone page. It behaves like a popup that slides in from the right side and appears only when triggered by the Cart Icon. You can also view and customize the Cart modal, including colors, fonts, and certain styling options. The Cart component and Cart Icon element work together to provide a seamless shopping experience:

Adding Items to the Cart

Customers add products to their cart using the Add To Cart button.


The Cart Icon updates dynamically to reflect the number of items in the cart.

Opening the Cart

Clicking the Cart Icon triggers the Cart Component, which slides in from the right.


The cart displays product details, prices, quantity controls, and a checkout option.

Managing Cart Contents

Customers can increase or decrease quantities or remove items directly from the cart.

A “Continue Shopping” button allows customers to return to browsing.

Proceeding to Checkout

Clicking “Checkout” takes customers to the Store Checkout Page to complete their purchase.

After completing an order, the cart resets to an empty state.

Accessing the Cart Component

From your workspace, navigate to the Store app in the left-hand menu.

Select Overview.

Click Design Store in the top-right corner.


Under the Site Theme Pages, Expand Store Front.

Select the Cart menu to preview the Cart modal.

Click the ⚙️ Edit Cart Settings option or anywhere in the cart modal to access the modal settings.


Adjust the settings and customize the design of the Cart modal.

Customizing the Cart Component

When you click the Cart component in the Theme, the Cart Modal will be displayed. Click the ⚙️ Edit Cart Settings option or tap anywhere within the modal preview to open its settings panel.
