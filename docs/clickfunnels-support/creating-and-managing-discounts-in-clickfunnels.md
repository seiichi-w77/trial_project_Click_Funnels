Discounts are reductions applied to the original price of a product or service, used to incentivize purchases and boost sales. They can attract new customers, retain existing ones, clear inventory, and enhance overall sales performance. ClickFunnels offers a comprehensive Discounts feature, enabling you to create and manage percentage-based and fixed-amount discounts for specific products or collections in both funnels and stores.

For example, you could offer a 10% discount to new customers to encourage their first purchase, or a fixed $20 off during a summer sale to clear inventory and boost seasonal sales. ClickFunnels equips you to create these discounts effortlessly.

In this article, You’ll learn how to craft strategic discount codes, explore various settings, track their usage, and integrate them seamlessly into your checkout process.

IMPORTANT

The Discounts feature is only compatible with the new Checkout element and will not work with the Legacy Checkout element.

Creating a Discount

Creating a discount code in ClickFunnels is a straightforward process that allows you to offer enticing deals to your customers. Follow these steps to set up your first discount code:

From your ClickFunnels dashboard, click on the Discounts app in the left-hand menu.

Click Create Discount to create a new discount.

Configure Discount Settings: After clicking “Create Discount”, you will be taken to a page where you can define the parameters of your discount:

Discount Name and Code:

Discount Name: Enter the name of the discount for internal reference (e.g., “Summer Sale”).

Coupon Code: Create a unique and memorable code for customers to use at checkout (e.g., “SUMMER23”).

Discount Type:

Percentage: A discount based on a percentage of the product price.

Fixed Amount: A specific dollar amount deducted from the product price.

Entitlements:

All Products: The discount applies to all products in your workspace.

Specific Products: The discount applies only to selected products.

Specific Collection: The discount applies to a specific collection of products.

Status:

Schedule Discount: Set a start and end date, along with the time zone, to define the active period of the discount. This feature is useful for time-limited promotions, such as seasonal sales. If not specified, the discount remains active indefinitely. For example, if you set a start date of June 1st at 9:00 AM Eastern Time and an end date of June 30th at 11:55 PM Eastern Time, the coupon will be active during this period and will expire after the end date. If not specified, the discount remains active indefinitely.

Expire Discount: Clicking on this option will expire the discount code immediately. The code will show invalid in the checkout.

Remove Expiration: If you have set a discount to expire, clicking the “Remove Expiration” option will re-activate the discount code. However, please note that you cannot unexpire a discount if the coupon has already been redeemed by customers and subsequently expired.

Advanced Settings:

Require Minimum Spend: Customers must spend a minimum amount to use the discount. If the minimum cart value is not met, the discount will not apply.

Note:

Stripe does not support the Minimum Spend option. If this feature is enabled, this discount code won't work correctly for Stripe transactions. Currently the Minimm Spend option will only work with Payments AI.

Limit to 1 Use per Customer: Each customer can use the discount only once.

Do Not Apply to All Invoices for an Order: Specify the number of invoices to which the discount will apply for subscription products. This setting is beneficial for managing recurring discounts. For example, if a customer subscribes to a product priced at $100 per month with a 20% discount applied, the discounted price is $80. If you set the discount to apply to three invoices, the customer will be charged $80 for the first three months. Starting from the fourth month, the regular price of $100 will be charged if the subscription continues.

Save Your Discount: Once you’ve entered all the details, click the Create Discount button to save your new discount code.

Managing Discount Activation and Expiration

Discounts have a lifecycle. There may come a time when you need to manually deactivate them. This can be done by expiring the discount code, rendering it inactive and preventing further use by customers. Conversely, if you’ve previously expired a discount code but want to bring it back, you can easily reactivate it and breathe new life into the promotion. Follow the steps below:
