Split testing, also known as A/B testing, is a marketing experiment where you split your audience into groups and show them different versions of your content. For instance, imagine you have a page where people can sign up for your newsletter. With split testing, you could show a sign-up form directly on the page for one group, and for the other group, you could show a pop-up form when they click a button. Then, you measure which version gets more people signing up. It’s a handy tool for marketers because it helps them determine which approach works best for getting more conversions. The Split Test feature in ClickFunnels allows you to create different versions of a funnel step within a funnel.

In this article, we’ll provide a detailed walkthrough of how to set up and manage split testing in your funnel steps.

Important

Each funnel step can accommodate a maximum of one variant page.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

A funnel page created in the Funnels section

Creating a Split Testing

Navigate to a funnel and locate the page you wish to split test.

Click the Three Dot ⋮ icon and choose Split test page.


In the prompt that appears, you can either create a new page or duplicate the existing one. Click New page to generate a fresh page or Duplicate … to instantly replicate your current page.


A variation page will then be added alongside the original page.

Split Testing on the First Page of The Funnel

Splits added to the top of a funnel behave differently than other splits. When a split test is added at the top of the funnel, the pages for the first step on either path are served at the funnel’s root URL. When you share the funnel's root URL, the system will display the first page without redirecting.  This feature is particularly important for platforms with strict policies, like Facebook, that disallow URL redirects. It also ensures compliance with advertising guidelines on major platforms.

When adding a split test to the first funnel step, remember to copy the funnel’s root URL instead of the page URL and share it with your audience.

Updating a Split Testing

By default, ClickFunnels sets the split rules to 100%-0%, meaning that 100% of the traffic is directed to the original page and 0% to the variant page when a split test is created. However, you can customize these settings by adjusting the Split Test Slider to your desired split ratio.

Navigate to a funnel and locate the split test you want to update.

Click on the split test widget.


Use the slider to set the split rule according to your preferences.

Click the Apply Change button to confirm your adjustments.
 

Removing a Split Testing

Navigate to a funnel and locate the split test you wish to delete.

Hover over to the split test widget and click the red Cross icon.


Choose the Left path to remove the original page or the Right path to remove the variant page. Then click the Remove button.
 

Viewing Split Test Analytics

Navigate to a funnel containing the split test.

In the top right corner, click the Analytics icon if it hasn’t been enabled already.


The page analytics will be displayed within the page thumbnail showing metrics such as Pageviewes, Opt-ins, Orders, Sales and more.
 

Testing Split Testing

Split testing on first step of the funnel: To initiate split testing on the first step of your funnel, simply copy the funnel’s root URL and paste it into a browser. ClickFunnels will automatically alternate between the variant pages according to the specified split rule on the first page of the funnel. During testing, the system will consistently display the funnel’s root URL, with the page path remaining invisible.

Testing Split Testing on Subsequent Funnel Steps: Since subsequent steps in the funnel don’t have special URL for split testing (because they’re not where the funnel starts). To make sure it’s right, you can either test the whole funnel right from the beginning or start from the step before. For example, if you’re testing an order page and just before it is a page where people sign up, you can go through the sign-up process and then check if the order page looks different each time you sign up. By repeating this process and submitting the opt-in page multiple times, you can observe whether different order form pages are displayed upon each submission.

Important

For optimal accuracy, we recommend running your split test for a minimum of 30 days. Allowing this duration gives the system ample time to stabilize and provide reliable split percentages between your variation pages.
