During the app installation, you will be prompted to create your first commission plan.

Understanding the Affiliate Area

The Affiliate Area is where your affiliates can log in, view their performance, and access promotional assets. After registering through your funnel, affiliates will receive a login URL to access their dashboard. They can track their clicks, conversions, commissions, and payouts.

Affiliate Payouts

Managing affiliate payouts is a vital part of running an affiliate program, ensuring your affiliates are compensated for their work. In ClickFunnels, payouts are currently handled manually, meaning the payments are processed outside the platform, and then the status is updated within ClickFunnels.

Here are the key things to know:

Manual Payouts: All affiliate payouts need to be manually processed through your chosen payment methods (e.g., PayPal, bank transfer, Wise, or Payoneer). Once payments are made, you will need to mark the commissions as PAID within the Payouts tab to keep track of completed transactions.

PayPal Payouts: You can pay affiliates directly using PayPal. Simply enter your PayPal Business Email in the Affiliate Center Settings. Ensure that your affiliates have added their PayPal email addresses to their profiles. You can also collect affiliates PayPal email in the registration form or add manually from their profile. Once both emails are set, you can process payments by clicking the PayPal button in the Payouts tab. The PayPal button will only appear for affiliates when PayPal email address is added to affiliates profile.

30-Day Cooling Down Period: Commissions are subject to a 30-day waiting period before they can be paid, allowing time for potential refunds or cancellations. After this period, commissions can be processed for payout.

Payout Threshold: Affiliates must also meet the payout threshold set within your workspace. This is the minimum commission amount required for payouts to be prepared. For example, if the threshold is set to $100, affiliates must earn at least $100 before their commissions can be processed.
