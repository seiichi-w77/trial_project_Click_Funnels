Accepting Payments in the Store and Funnels

ClickFunnels allows you to accept payments through both the Online Store and Funnels, providing flexibility in how you sell products.

Accepting Payments in the Store:

When you create a product and set its sales channel visibility as Online Store, it will automatically appear in the Storefront. This means you do not need to manually attach products to the Store app. ClickFunnels handles the display automatically with dynamic collection elements. Customers can browse the storefront and purchase products seamlessly.

To learn more about setting up and customizing the Store, refer to the article Getting Started with ClickFunnels Store.

Accepting Payments in a Funnel:

To sell a product through a funnel, you must create a Checkout Page that includes the Checkout element. Once the checkout page is set up, attach the product to the funnel step where the checkout occurs. This setup ensures that payments can be collected directly within the funnel.

After adding the checkout page and linking the product, test the process to ensure smooth transactions.

Learn more about funnel steps in the article, How to Add and Manage Funnel Steps.

Testing Payments

Testing your payment setup is essential to ensure smooth transactions and prevent issues before going live. ClickFunnels provides various testing options for both the Store and Funnels, allowing you to verify payment flows without processing real transactions.


Testing Payments in the Store

You can test your store checkout process by temporarily disabling a product's Sales Channel Visibility and turning off Live Mode. Once these settings are adjusted, visit the product link to complete a test purchase using the test card number (e.g.,  4111-1111-1111-1111) and validate the checkout experience.

For a detailed guide, refer to the article How to Test Store Checkout in TEST Mode.

Testing Payments in the Funnel

To test payments in a funnel, enable Test Mode in your Funnel Settings. Once activated, a Test Card number (e.g., 4111-1111-1111-1111) will be displayed at the top of the Checkout Page, allowing you to simulate transactions without using real payment information.

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the article How to Test Funnel Checkout in Test / Sandbox Mode.

Testing Payments Without a Payment Gateway

If you want to test the order flow without connecting a payment gateway, ClickFunnels offers an alternative method. This allows you to verify the checkout experience and ensure that orders are being processed correctly, even before integrating a payment provider.
