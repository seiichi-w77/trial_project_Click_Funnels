Organizing your community effectively is key to keeping members engaged and ensuring smooth communication. In this article, we’ll cover how to create and manage Groups and Topics within the ClickFunnels Community app. By using Groups and Topics to organize your community, you can create targeted discussions that keep members engaged and make content easier to find, leading to a more vibrant and active community.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

A Community created in the Community app

Understanding Groups and Topics

Groups: These are the main categories in your community, used to organize members around broad themes or interests. Groups help you segment discussions and content based on shared goals or topics relevant to specific segments of your audience.

Topics: Topics exist within Groups and focus on more specific discussions. They serve as conversation threads where members can interact on detailed subjects, keeping the conversation focused and organized within the group.

Examples of How to Use Groups and Topics:

A fitness business could structure its community using Groups and Topics like this:

Groups:    

Beginner Workouts: A space for new members to access basic exercises and guidance.

Nutrition Tips: A Group dedicated to sharing meal plans, dietary advice, and healthy recipes.

Topics within the Beginner Workouts Group:    

Daily Exercise Routines: Share workout plans and allow members to discuss their progress.

Stretching Tips: Offer tips on injury prevention and improving flexibility.

Ask a Trainer: Host Q&A sessions where members can ask fitness experts for advice.

Accessing Groups and Topics

Navigate to the Community app from the left menu.

From the Community dashboard, you’ll see a list of existing Groups and the option to create new ones.

To manage Topics within a Group, select the Group to access the Topics page.
