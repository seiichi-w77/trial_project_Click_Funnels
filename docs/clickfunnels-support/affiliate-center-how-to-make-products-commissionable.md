How to Turn On Commission in a Product

By default, any new product created in ClickFunnels is set to be commissionable. However, if you have an existing product that does not have the commission option turned on, you can enable it in the product settings. Here’s how you can do that:

Create a Product in ClickFunnels:

From the left side of the navigation, click Products and then All Products menu.

Click Create Product and enter the required details such as Product Name, Price, and Description.

Choose the appropriate product type and configure additional settings, such as inventory and shipping, if applicable.

For a more comprehensive guide on creating a product, refer to our How to Create and Manage a Product article.

Enable Commission for the Product:

In the product settings, scroll down to the Commission Settings section.

Check the Commissionable box. This action ensures that affiliates can promote this product and earn commissions. Unchecking the “Commissionable” option will not provide the commission to the affiliates.

Override Commission Plans for Specific Products:

In the Commission Settings section, you can override the default commission plan for a specific product.

Click Add under Commission Plan Product Overrides and select the desired commission plan.


Select the Commission Plan from the dropdown menu.

Enter the Tier 1 commission amount. Use the dropdown to choose between % or USD.

Choose the Event Type, either Recurring or One Time.

(Optional) Enter the Tier 2 commission amount, if applicable.

Click Create to save the override.

Understanding Commission Plan Overrides

Commission plans in ClickFunnels have a hierarchy and can be complex to understand. For a deeper dive into creating and managing commission plans, refer to our dedicated article: Affiliate Center - Creating and Managing Commission Plans. This guide will help you understand how to set up commission structures that align with your business goals.

Viewing Commissionable Products in the Affiliate Center

Once a product is set as commissionable, it will automatically appear in the Commissionable Products section of the Affiliate Center app.

Go to the Affiliate Center app in your ClickFunnels dashboard.

Click on Commissionable Products to view a list of all products that are enabled for commissions. You can also directly set specific overrides for each product regarding commission plans from this page.

Click on the product's name or adjacent gear (⚙️) icon to edit its commission settings and apply overrides as needed for each affiliate commission plan.
