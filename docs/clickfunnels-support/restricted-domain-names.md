When connecting a domain to your ClickFunnels workspace, certain names are restricted due to trademark protections or internal use. If your domain includes one of these restricted terms, you will see an error message preventing you from proceeding.


Why Some Domains Are Restricted

To ensure compliance with legal requirements and protect trademarked terms, ClickFunnels restricts domains that contain:

Trademarked phrases such as "ClickFunnels"

Brand references to ClickFunnels or other protected brands

Internally reserved terms used by ClickFunnels for system configuration or product features

This is done to avoid legal conflicts and maintain platform integrity.

Example:

If you attempt to connect a domain like clickfunnelshelp.com, you'll receive an error message:

“Includes a trademarked phrase. Please select another domain name.”

This message means that your domain includes a trademark phrase that is protected or reserved, and you must choose a different name to continue.

Restricted Domain Names FAQs
Can I use “ClickFunnels” in my domain as an affiliate?

No. Even as an affiliate, you are not permitted to use “ClickFunnels” or any variation of it in your domain name. This violates trademark policy.
