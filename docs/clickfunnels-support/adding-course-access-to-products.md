This article explains how to grant access to your course content through product purchases. After setup, anyone who buys these products can access the course modules you’ve selected. By adding course access to products, you can sell your courses as part of product packages, adding value to your offerings.

Here’s how this benefits your business:

Increase product value by including course access.

Sell courses alongside physical or digital items.

Create different product tiers with varying course content.

Turn free courses into bonuses for paid products.

You can add course access to multiple products. This lets you create different offerings or membership levels to suit various customer needs.
