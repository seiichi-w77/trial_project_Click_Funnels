How the Add To Cart Element Works

The Add To Cart element is designed to work exclusively within the Store Product page. The Cart Icon element must also be on the same page to function properly. This integration ensures that the customers can easily manage their cart while browsing and selecting products.


Here’s how it works:

The Add To Cart element reads the product context from the page where it’s placed and adds that product to the shopper’s cart. The Cart Icon element should be present on the same page to ensure the cart panel is visible and updates in real time.

Product Context and Selection:

On a Store Product page, the element references the product currently being viewed.

On Storefront or Collection pages and on Site or Landing pages with a Products Collection element, the element references the product shown in the associated product card.

Adding to Cart: On the Product page, customers can choose their desired options (if applicable) and click the Add To Cart button, which triggers the cart functionality.

Cart Display: When a customer adds a product to the cart, the Cart Icon element ensures that the shopping cart becomes visible from the right-hand panel of the page. This panel allows users to view the items they’ve added, modify quantities, or proceed to checkout.

Combining the Add To Cart and Cart Icon elements creates a streamlined and intuitive process for customers to select and purchase products from your store. This setup enhances user experience and drives conversions, making the shopping journey effortless.
