Understanding the Importance of Store Design

The design of your store isn’t just about making things look good—it directly impacts how customers interact with your business. A thoughtfully customized store makes it easier for customers to navigate, understand product details, and complete purchases. It can improve customer satisfaction and increase your sales by making the shopping experience smooth and intuitive.

Why Store Design is Critical:

Guiding Customer Behavior: A well-organized store helps customers find what they’re looking for without confusion. Strategic use of visuals, and clear product information makes the shopping process straightforward, reducing the chances of customers abandoning their journey.

Building Trust and Credibility: Customers expect a professional, trustworthy shopping environment. Your store’s design should reflect your brand’s identity, creating a cohesive look and feel that customers recognize and trust.

Boosting Sales and Conversions: A store that is easy to use encourages customers to stay longer, explore more products, and complete their purchases. Simple adjustments like optimizing the product layout or improving the checkout process can significantly impact your conversion rates.

By learning how to customize each section of your store, you’re not just improving aesthetics—you’re building a better experience for your customers that can drive long-term business growth.

Click the preview 👁 icon next to a theme to view its design and layout.

How to Access the Store Editor

Before you begin customizing, you need to access the store theme editor. Follow these steps:

From the Store Dashboard, click Design Store to access the Theme Editor.

Once you’re in the Theme Editor, you’ll see different store pages that you can begin customizing.

Overview of the Store Theme Pages

Your store theme is divided into multiple Site Theme Pages, each corresponding to a specific part of your store’s user journey. These pages include:

Store Front: The homepage of your store. This is where you introduce your brand, feature key products, and highlight promotions or collections.

Product Page: Displays individual product details such as the name, price, images, and descriptions.

Collection Page: Groups related products together, helping customers browse by category or theme.

Cart Page: Shows items the customer has added to their shopping cart, allowing them to review quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout.

Checkout Page: Facilitates the final step in the purchase process. Customers enter their shipping and payment details to complete their orders.

Order Confirmation Page: Summarizes the completed order, providing customers with purchase details and confirmation.

Upsell Page: Offers additional products after the initial purchase, encouraging customers to add complementary items and increase overall order value.


Each of these pages is important to the overall user experience. Customizing them allows you to shape the look and feel of your store, creating a consistent brand presentation while ensuring an intuitive shopping process.

Understanding the Theme Structure

Each of these theme pages is built using a combination of Sections, Rows, and Elements, as displayed in the Theme Editor. Here’s what each part represents:

Sections: Large containers that divide the page into different areas (like the header, product listings, or footer).

Rows: Break down sections further, allowing you to organize your content within them.

Elements: The individual components that sit within rows, such as images, text, buttons, and product displays.
