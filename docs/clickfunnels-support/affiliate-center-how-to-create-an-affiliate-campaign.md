What is an Affiliate Campaign

An affiliate campaign is a promotional strategy set up by ClickFunnels users in the Affiliate Center that allows affiliates to promote a specific funnel. Each campaign is linked to a funnel and has a commission plan associated with it, determining how much commission affiliates will earn for sales generated through their promotions.

In the context of creating an affiliate program in the ClickFunnels Affiliate Center, affiliate campaigns play a crucial role. For instance, let’s say you are a fitness coach offering an exclusive “Workout With Me - Masterclass 2024.” You could create an affiliate campaign specifically for this masterclass funnel, where affiliates would promote the masterclass to their audiences. Within the campaign settings, you can provide affiliates with all the essential marketing materials, such as engaging workout videos, promotional banners, email templates, and social media graphics. This comprehensive set of resources empowers your affiliates to market the masterclass effectively, ensuring a higher conversion rate.

How to Create an Affiliate Campaign

Creating an affiliate campaign in ClickFunnels involves a few simple steps. Follow these guidelines to set up your campaign:

Go to the Affiliate Center app in your ClickFunnels dashboard.

Click on the Campaigns tab. This will show you a list of all existing campaigns.

Click on the Create Campaign button.

Complete the setup of your campaign settings:  

Name: Enter the campaign name.

Description: Enter your campaign description.

Funnel: Select the funnel you want affiliates to promote.

NOTE

You can only select one funnel per campaign. Ensure the selected funnel contains a checkout page with a product attached to it.

Hidden from Affiliates: Toggle this option if you want to hide the campaign from your affiliates. If turned on, affiliates cannot view this campaign in their affiliate center.

Campaign Date: Set the start and end dates for the campaign. If the campaign has no end date, leave the field blank. The campaign will automatically be hidden in the affiliate center when the end date is reached.

Asset URL (Optional): Provide a URL where affiliates can access promotional assets such as email copy, banners, images, and videos. This helps affiliates market the campaign effectively. You can create a funnel page or a landing page that provides all the content related to your campaign. Copy the funnel page URL or landing page URL and paste the URL in the Asset URL field.

Click Create Campaign to save your setup.

After the campaign is created, the Commission Plans section will appear. Select the commission plans you want to add to the campaign. Affiliates with these commission plans can promote and earn commissions from this campaign.

In the Commission Plans section, click on Add to include a commission plan.

Select one or more commission plans from the dropdown menu and click Add Commission Plan. Affiliates with the selected commission plans can promote this campaign. If you do not add a commission plan in the campaign, the default commission will be applied when an affiliate promotes the product.

Understanding Commission Plan

Commission plans in ClickFunnels have a hierarchy and can be complex to understand. For a deeper dive into creating and managing commission plans, refer to our dedicated article: Affiliate Center - Creating and Managing Commission Plans. This guide will help you understand how to set up commission structures that align with your business goals.

No Usable Commission Plans
If all existing commission plans have been added, you’ll see a message suggesting you create a new one. If you still want to add a new plan, click Create Commission Plan to set it up.

Once all settings are configured, click Save Changes to create your affiliate campaign. The campaign will now be available for affiliates to promote based on the visibility settings you selected.

Where to Find Campaigns in the Affiliate Area

Affiliates can easily find the campaigns available to them in the Affiliate Area:

In the affiliate dashboard, scroll down to the Campaigns section at the bottom of the page.

All available campaigns that match the affiliate’s commission plan will be visible here.

Affiliates can click the Copy icon next to the campaign name to copy their unique affiliate URL. They can use this URL to promote the campaign to their audience and earn commissions based on the campaign’s settings.
