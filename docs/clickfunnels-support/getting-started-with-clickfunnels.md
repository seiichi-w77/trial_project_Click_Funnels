Understanding ClickFunnels Team and Workspace

Your Team Workspace is where collaboration happens. Here’s what you need to know:

What is a Team

A Team is essentially the main ClickFunnels account. When someone signs up for ClickFunnels, a team is automatically created. The team becomes the main business account, or the "headquarters.”

Each ClickFunnels account has only one team.

A team can have multiple team members (like designers, marketers, or developers) invited to collaborate.

What is a Workspace

A Workspace is like a sub-account within the team/main account. It’s where the actual work happens, such as building funnels, setting up automations, or publishing pages.

Workspace = where ClickFunnels features live.

Depending on the ClickFunnels plan, a team can create multiple workspaces.

Navigating Your Workspaces

After logging into your ClickFunnels account, navigate to the bottom left corner of the dashboard. Click on the name or icon next to the current workspace name to view the team and all associated workspaces. From this menu, you can select a different workspace or click on 'Team Settings' to manage the team name and add or remove workspaces as needed.

Adding Your Workspace Marketing Contact Address

Your marketing contact address, also called your business address, is a vital component of your ClickFunnels workspace. This address is used for compliance with email marketing regulations and ensures that your communications meet branding and legal standards. Including your business's physical address in marketing emails is crucial for legal compliance, building trust, and maintaining brand consistency. Laws like the CAN-SPAM Act require a valid postal address in emails to identify the sender and prevent fraudulent communications. Displaying your address enhances credibility, demonstrating that your business is legitimate and transparent. It also reinforces your brand identity by providing a consistent point of contact for customers.

How to Set Up Your Marketing Contact Address

Log in to your ClickFunnels account.

Navigate to Workspace Settings » Email Settings » General Settings.


Enter your business address in the designated fields in the ‘Marketing contact address’ section.

Save your changes to ensure the address is applied to all marketing communications.

For a detailed walkthrough, refer to our article Email Settings - General Settings.

Creating Your First Funnel

A funnel is a series of steps designed to guide visitors toward a specific goal, such as making a purchase, signing up for a service, or downloading a resource. Creating your first funnel in ClickFunnels is designed to cater to various business needs while remaining simple and intuitive.


Creating Funnels from Templates

To begin, access the Funnels menu from the left-hand navigation panel. Click on the "Create Funnel" button to get started. You can select from various templates, such as lead funnels, summit funnels, book funnels, or cart funnels. Each template is tailored to a specific purpose, helping you get started quickly. Alternatively, you can build your funnel from scratch for complete customization, ensuring it aligns with your unique goals.

Smart Funnel Building with AI

ClickFunnels also offers the innovative Smart Funnel Builder, an AI-powered tool that simplifies funnel creation. With this tool, you can specify the funnel type, select branding colors and styles, choose image types, and add content preferences. The AI then generates a customized funnel based on your inputs, saving you time and effort while ensuring the design matches your business needs.

Navigating the Site & Blog App

Connecting Your Domain

ClickFunnels simplifies the process of connecting your domain, offering two methods to suit your preferences and technical expertise:
  

Automatic Method: Navigate to Workspace Settings > Domains, select "Connect existing domain," and type your domain name. Authorize the connection with your domain’s DNS provider. ClickFunnels will automatically handle all the required DNS records, ensuring your domain is set up correctly and providing free SSL.

Manual Method: If you prefer more control, you can manually add the necessary DNS records to your domain’s DNS provider. Once the records are added, verify your domain in ClickFunnels and enable SSL.

Default Subdomain

When you create a ClickFunnels account, a default subdomain (e.g., yourbusiness.myclickfunnels.com) is automatically provided. This subdomain is ideal for testing and exploring ClickFunnels features, but is not recommended for live business operations. Connecting a custom domain ensures your brand maintains a professional and credible online presence.

Setting Up Automation

ClickFunnels provides the powerful Automations app that allows you to create Workflows and Quick Actions to streamline your business processes. These automation tools help you link various apps within your workspace to trigger specific events, saving you time and ensuring efficiency.

Workflows are comprehensive automation sequences that perform a series of actions based on specific triggers and conditions. For instance, if you have a sales funnel selling supplements, you can set up an abandoned cart sequence in a workflow. This workflow triggers when a customer adds a product to their cart but doesn't complete the purchase, initiating a series of reminder emails or follow-ups to encourage completion. This helps retain customers and boost sales.

Quick Actions, on the other hand, are immediate, single-step tasks executed in response to specific events. For example, when a customer completes a purchase, a quick action can instantly send a confirmation email or update the customer’s status in your CRM. These actions are perfect for straightforward processes requiring prompt responses.

Sending Emails From ClickFunnels

ClickFunnels allows you to send marketing and automated emails without requiring any external email hosting or additional email servers. Using the powerful Email app and Automation Workflows feature, you can send emails directly from a custom email address associated with your domain.

Sending Emails with the Email App

The Email app is ideal for one-time email broadcasts to your audience. This app makes it simple whether you need to share updates, promotions, or announcements. You can send emails immediately or schedule them for a future date, ensuring your communication reaches your audience at the perfect time.

Sending Emails with Automation Workflows

Automation Workflows take your email strategy to the next level. You can add "Send Email" steps within a workflow to automate personalized communication. For instance, you can set up a workflow that sends a welcome email when a customer subscribes or a reminder email if they abandon their cart. This ensures timely and relevant interactions with your audience, boosting engagement and conversions.

For example, imagine you have a sales funnel for supplements. If a customer adds a product to their cart but doesn’t complete the purchase, a workflow can trigger a series of reminder emails to encourage them to finalize their order, helping you retain customers and drive sales.

Creating Your First Course or Membership Site in ClickFunnels

The ClickFunnels Courses app enables you to create, manage, and deliver online courses effortlessly.

Adding the Courses App

To begin, ensure the Courses app is added to your workspace. This app serves as the foundation for building and organizing your course content. Once added, you’re ready to start creating your course.


Selecting Course Type

ClickFunnels offers three primary course types to suit your needs. Start by selecting the Simple Course option, which automatically provides a ready-made layout. This includes modules and lessons optimized for mobile responsiveness and design—you won’t have to worry about layouts or technical configurations. For more flexibility, choose the Custom Course type. This allows you to customize the templates for modules and lessons, giving you full control over the course’s appearance and structure.

For instance, if you’re offering a fitness training program, you can create modules for different workout routines, include instructional videos, and provide downloadable meal plans for your students. The Course app ensures a professional and engaging learning experience while keeping the setup simple and efficient.

Creating a New Product

To create a product, navigate to your workspace and access the Products menu. Click Create Product to create a product from scratch or Add from Zendrop to import a product from a Zendrop account.


Attaching Products to Stores and Funnels

Once your product is created, you can attach it to your funnel pages or make it visible for the workspace store app. For a store, simply turn on the sales channel visibility in the product settings. For funnels, link the product to a checkout step to enable customers to purchase it directly. This seamless integration ensures your products are visible and accessible wherever your audience interacts with your business.
