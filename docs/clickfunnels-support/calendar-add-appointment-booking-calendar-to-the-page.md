This widget seamlessly integrates with your pre-created Event Types from the Appointments app in your ClickFunnels workspace.

In this article, you will learn how to use the Calendar element.


Requirements

A funnel page

An Event Type created in the Appointments app in your workspace

Creating an Event Type

From the left-hand main menu, click the Appointments app.

Select Event Types.

Click the Add Event Type button to create a new event.


Choose the Event Type you wish to create. The available options are:


One-on-One: This event type is ideal for 1:1 interviews, sales meetings, or casual coffee chats. It involves one host and one invitee.

Group (COMING SOON): Suitable for webinars or online classes, this event type will involve one host and a group of invitees.

Attaching the Appointment Event Type in the Funnel Step

Navigate to the funnel step where you want to use the appointment event type.

Click the three-dot icon on the funnel step (such as an Opt-in page), and select Manage Event Types.


In the sidebar, click Attach Event and select the event you want to link to this funnel step. Once you've done this, click Update.

Adding a Calendar Element in the Page Editor

Inside the page editor, add a Section where you want to place the element.

Add a Row within that section.

Click the orange + Plus or Add New Element button inside the row to insert a new element.

From the Misc (Miscellaneous) category, select the Calendar element.


Once the Calendar element is added, you can customize its appearance to fit your page design.

Tips:

The Calendar is a fully integrated widget that displays key booking components, such as event details, a calendar, and a contact form. To ensure it displays correctly and avoids content distortion, consider placing this element within a one-column row to provide adequate space.

Customizing the Calendar Element

When you hover over an element, its border will be highlighted in orange. To access an element's settings, click on the gear ⚙️ icon or click directly on the element.

Previewing

When an Event Type is attached to the funnel step and the Calendar element is added, you can use the Preview 👁️ icon in the editor to view how the appointment widget appears. The widget will dynamically display all necessary details from your Event Type, including the event name, host information, meeting time and location, time zone, and a calendar showing available slots. Depending on your Event Type setup, users will also see options to select a time slot and the booking form.

Limitations

Exclusive to Funnel Pages: The Calendar element is designed to work exclusively within funnel pages. It cannot be used on the site, landing pages, blogs, courses, or other pages of your workspace.

No Payment Processing for Paid Events: If your Event Type requires payment, the Calendar element will not handle payment processing during the booking. Instead, you can use one of the following alternative methods:

Option 2: Embed the booking form directly on your webpage.

Option 3: Share the direct event link with your audience for seamless access.

For detailed instructions on these methods, refer to the article Appointments - How to Publish Your ClickFunnels Appointments.


Automatic Funnel Navigation After Booking: When using the Calendar element in a funnel, users will automatically be redirected to the next funnel step after booking. The “After Booking” settings defined in the “Event Type” will not take priority. If you prefer not to show the next funnel step after booking, consider publishing your event using Option 2 or Option 3.

One Scheduler Per Page: Only one Calendar element can function properly on a single page. Adding multiple scheduler elements may lead to display or functionality issues.
