ClickFunnels offers a robust feature that allows you to manually add discounts to subscription orders, providing flexibility and enhanced customer satisfaction. This functionality is particularly useful when you need to apply special promotions or rectify issues on a case-by-case basis. Manually adding discounts can help retain customers and improve their overall experience by offering them personalized deals. For example, if a customer subscribes to a weekly delivery of a product, you can manually add a discount to their order to offer a loyalty reward or a promotional price.

In this article, you will learn how to navigate to your ClickFunnels dashboard to manually apply discounts to subscription orders, ensuring these discounts are reflected in future invoices.
