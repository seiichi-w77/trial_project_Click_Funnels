Tags in ClickFunnels are essential for keeping your audience organized and helping you run efficient workflows. They function similarly to "lists" in ClickFunnels Classic, allowing you to segment contacts and manage interactions effectively. You can also add tags manually for more precise updates. This article explains how to apply tags to contacts using funnels, ensuring your contact management is simple and effective.

Requirements

An active ClickFunnels account

A funnel created in your workspace

Applying Tags Automatically Through Funnels

To add tags automatically, you’ll need to connect a workflow to your funnel. Workflows allow you to automate actions like tagging contacts when they complete a funnel step. This ensures your tags are applied automatically, saving you time and keeping your audience organized. To learn more about creating Workflows, refer to the How to Create Workflows article.

Navigate to the Funnels section in your ClickFunnels dashboard.

Click on the funnel you wish to add a step to open the Funnel Workflow Editor.

Identify the specific funnel step (e.g., an opt-in page) where you want the workflow to be triggered.

Click the Lightning Bolt icon next to the funnel step.

In the Choose an existing workflow window, you can:

Select an existing workflow: Browse the available workflows and click Select on the one you want to attach.

Create a new workflow: Click New Workflow at the top right.

If you’re creating a new workflow:

Enter a name for the workflow.

Choose an Event Type (e.g., “Opt-in” or “Order – Successful Purchase”) to set the trigger for the workflow.

Click Create Workflow to proceed.

In the workflow editor, add a Tag Contact action:

Select Tag Contact from the right-hand panel. 

Choose whether to Add Tag(s) or Remove Tag(s) and specify the tags to apply.

Click Create Step to save the action.

Once the workflow is set up, enable it by toggling the switch at the top-right corner. Confirm the action by clicking Enable.

Go back to the funnel editor to confirm that the workflow is correctly attached and displayed as active for the funnel step.

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, refer to the Workflows "Tag Contact" Step - Apply or Remove Tags to Contacts article.

Manually Applying Tags to Contacts

If you’ve collected contacts through a funnel before attaching a workflow for automatic tagging, you can manually add tags to those contacts to ensure they are properly segmented. This method allows you to update existing contacts and keep your data consistent.

To manually apply tags:

Navigate to the Customers section in your workspace and select Contacts.

Check the box next to each contact you want to manage.

Once your contacts are selected:    

For single contacts, click Actions to manage that contact.

For multiple contacts, click Bulk Actions to apply changes to all selected contacts at once.

Click Tag from the Actions or Bulk Actions menu.

Select whether to Add or Remove a tag, then choose the relevant tag.

The tag will be applied immediately. To schedule the tagging process for later, check the Schedule box and select a date.

Click Perform tag action.
