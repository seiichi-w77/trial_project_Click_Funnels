A One-Time Offer (OTO) is a follow-up offer shown to customers immediately after they complete a purchase. OTOs can be used as upsells, encouraging customers to add higher-value or complementary products to their order. They can also act as downsells, offering a lower-priced option to customers who decline a previous offer.

OTOs give you a chance to increase the total value of each sale while providing customers with options that align with their needs. This article will walk you through what OTOs are, why they’re helpful, and how to set them up in your funnel.

Understanding One-Time Offer (OTO)

A One-Time Offer is an additional product or service presented after a customer completes a purchase. It’s designed to fit naturally into the buying process and can be customized to fit your goals:

Use an upsell to encourage customers to upgrade their purchase or add complementary items.

Use a downsell to offer a less expensive alternative for customers who decide not to take the original upsell.

Why Use an OTO?
OTOs are a proven strategy to:

Increase revenue per customer by offering complementary or exclusive products.

Build trust by showcasing deals that feel like a special opportunity.

Tap into impulse buying behavior with urgency and scarcity.

Examples of OTO Use Cases:

A customer buys a fitness program, and you offer a personalized meal plan as an add-on.

Provide a subscription trial upgrade to an annual plan at a reduced cost.

If a customer declines an annual subscription upgrade, you offer them a monthly subscription at a discounted rate.

Adding an OTO Page to Your Funnel

Navigate to the Funnels menu and open the funnel where you want to add the OTO.

Click on the funnel you wish to add a step to open the funnel workflow editor.

After the checkout page in the funnel, hover over and click on the + Circle to add a new step.
