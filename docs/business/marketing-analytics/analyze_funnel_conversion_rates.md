To execute the "Analyze_Funnel_Conversion_Rates" command, I require specific numerical data regarding the conversion funnel. The provided project context details many aspects of the Global Video Hackathon 2025, community activities, and partnerships, but it does not include the raw data necessary to calculate conversion rates.

Specifically, I need the following information for each step of the funnel:

1.  **Website Visitors (ウェブサイト訪問者数):** The total number of unique visitors to the relevant website(s) during a specified period.
2.  **Community Participants/Sign-ups (コミュニティ参加者数/登録者数):** The number of individuals who joined the community (e.g., WAY to AGI, Shift AI) after visiting the website.
3.  **Event Registrations (イベント登録者数):** The number of individuals who registered for an event (e.g., Global Video Hackathon 2025, upcoming December events) after visiting the website or joining the community.

Please provide this data so I can proceed with calculating the conversion rates and identifying potential bottlenecks.
